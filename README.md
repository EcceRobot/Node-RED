# Node-RED


## Set up Node-RED
It requires **Node.js LTS 8.x**, so check the current version:
```
node -v
```
If the version is not correct, send the commands **as root, not with sudo**
```
# curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_8.x | bash -
# apt install -y nodejs
```

Then, you can use **npm**.
Check if it's present
```
npm -v
```
and if not







```
sudo npm install -g --unsafe-perm node-red
```
